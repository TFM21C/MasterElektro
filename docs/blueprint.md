# **App Name**: CircuitCraft

## Core Features:

- Drag-and-Drop Interface: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating and manipulating electrical components and connections.
- Component Library: Library of standard electrical components (switches, motors, lamps, etc.) with adjustable properties like labels and pin configurations.
- Circuit State Visualization: Visual representation of circuit states, with color-coded lines indicating current flow based on switch positions.
- AI-Powered Circuit Suggestion: Generative AI tool that takes a description of a desired circuit behavior and recommends suitable circuit configurations from a library of templates.
- SVG Export: Export the designed circuit as a clean, scalable vector graphic (SVG) for documentation and sharing.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to reflect the app's focus on electricity and technology.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) for a clean and neutral canvas.
- Accent color: Soft green (#BDFFB4) to highlight interactive elements.
- Clean and legible sans-serif font for labels and UI elements.
- Use distinct and recognizable icons for components in the library, following established electrical symbols.
- Clearly structured interface with a component palette on the left, the design canvas in the center, and a properties sidebar on the right.
